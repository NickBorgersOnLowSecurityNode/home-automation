## Quick Links

### For Engineers / AI Agents
Technical reference documentation for development:
- **[architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md](./architecture/ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Complete system design
- **[reference/SHADOW_STATE.md](./reference/SHADOW_STATE.md)** - Shadow state pattern (**READ BEFORE WRITING PLUGINS**)
- **[reference/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md](./reference/PLUGIN_SYSTEM.md)** - Plugin interfaces
- **[reference/migration_mapping.md](./reference/migration_mapping.md)** - State variable mapping
- **[reference/CONCURRENCY_LESSONS.md](./reference/CONCURRENCY_LESSONS.md)** - Concurrency patterns

### For Human Developers
Visual documentation for understanding the system:
- **[human/VISUAL_ARCHITECTURE.md](./human/VISUAL_ARCHITECTURE.md)** - Mermaid diagrams
- **[human/DIAGRAM_QUICK_START.md](./human/DIAGRAM_QUICK_START.md)** - Diagram navigation guide

### Operations
Deployment and process documentation:
- **[operations/DOCKER.md](./operations/DOCKER.md)** - Docker deployment
- **[operations/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md](./operations/BRANCH_PROTECTION.md)** - PR requirements

### Archive
Historical and proposal documents (not required reading):
- **[archive/](./archive/)** - Old analysis, future work proposals

## Root-Level Documentation

Some documentation files remain in the repository root because they are required there:
- **[CLAUDE.md](../CLAUDE.md)** - Claude Code project instructions (must be in root)
- **[AGENTS.md](../AGENTS.md)** - Development guide for AI agents (must be in root)
- **[README.md](../README.md)** - Project overview (standard location)

## Contributing

When adding new documentation:
1. Place it in the appropriate subdirectory based on its audience:
   - `human/` for visual, diagram-heavy docs
   - `reference/` for technical patterns and guides
   - `operations/` for deployment and process docs
   - `archive/` for historical or proposal documents
2. Update this README with a link to the new document
3. Update AGENTS.md if it's required reading for development
4. Follow markdown best practices (headers, links, code blocks)
